## Contributing Process

We follow a **lazy consensus** approach: changes proposed by people with responsibility for a problem, without disagreement from others, within a bounded time window of review by their peers, should be accepted.

### Types of Contributions

#### 1. Features with Public APIs or New Components

All features involving public APIs, behavior between core components, or new core subsystems must be accompanied by an **approved project proposal**.

**Process:**

1. Create a pull request adding a proposal document under `./docs/proposals/` with a descriptive name
2. Include these sections: Summary, Motivation (Goals/Non-Goals), Proposal, Design Details, Alternatives
3. Get review from impacted component maintainers
4. Get approval from project maintainers

#### 2. Fixes, Issues, and Bugs

For changes that fix broken code or add small changes within a component:

* All bugs and commits must have a clear description of the bug, how to reproduce, and how the change is made
* Any other changes can be proposed in a pull request — a maintainer must approve the change
* For moderate size changes, create an RFC issue in GitHub, then engage in Slack

## Code Review Requirements

* **All code changes** must be submitted as pull requests (no direct pushes)
* **All changes** must be reviewed and approved by a maintainer other than the author
* **All repositories** must gate merges on compilation and passing tests
* **All experimental features** must be off by default and require explicit opt-in

## Commit and Pull Request Style

* **Pull requests** should describe the problem succinctly
* **Rebase and squash** before merging
* **Use minimal commits** and break large changes into distinct commits
* **Commit messages** should have:
  * Short, descriptive titles
  * Description of why the change was needed
  * Enough detail for someone reviewing git history to understand the scope
* **DCO Sign-off**: All commits must include a valid DCO sign-off line (`Signed-off-by: Name <email@domain.com>`)
  * Add automatically with `git commit -s`
  * See [PR_SIGNOFF.md](PR_SIGNOFF.md) for configuration details
  * Required for all contributions per [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/)

## Code Organization and Ownership

* **Components** are the primary unit of code organization
* **Maintainers** own components and approve changes
* **Contributors** can become maintainers through sufficient evidence of contribution
* Code ownership is reflected in [OWNERS files](https://go.k8s.io/owners) consistent with Kubernetes project conventions

## Testing Requirements

We use three tiers of testing:

1. **Unit tests**: Fast verification of code parts, testing different arguments
2. **Integration tests**: Testing protocols between components and built artifacts
3. **End-to-end (e2e) tests**: Whole system testing including benchmarking

Strong e2e coverage is required for deployed systems to prevent performance regression. Appropriate test coverage is an important part of code review.

### Running Tests Locally

```bash
# Unit tests (default, no external dependencies)
make test

# Integration tests (each test spawns its own in-process mock server)
make test-integration

# Both unit and integration tests
make test-all

# E2E tests (requires docker/podman, kind, helm, kubectl)
make test-e2e
```

Integration tests use the `//go:build integration` build tag and live in `test/integration/`. They are excluded from `make test` and only run when the tag is explicitly passed via `make test-integration`. Each test spawns its own mock server (miniredis, `httptest.Server`) — no external services are required.

To add a new integration test, create a `*_test.go` file in `test/integration/` with the build tag:

```go
//go:build integration

package integration_test
```

## Releasing

This repository is a multi-module Go repo. The lightweight sub-modules (`api`, `pipeline`, `producer`, `producer-sql`) each have their own `go.mod` so that external consumers can depend on them without pulling in the heavyweight root module.

### Preparing a release

1. Update cross-module version references:

```bash
make set-version VERSION=v0.8.0
```

This rewrites all `require` directives across `go.mod` files and runs `go mod tidy`. Sub-modules are detected automatically from subdirectories containing a `go.mod`.

2. Commit the result and push a tag on the root module:

```bash
git tag v0.8.0
git push origin v0.8.0
```

3. The `CI - Tag Go Submodules` workflow automatically creates the prefixed tags required by Go modules (e.g. `api/v0.8.0`, `pipeline/v0.8.0`, `producer/v0.8.0`, `producer-sql/v0.8.0`).

Go requires sub-module tags to carry the directory prefix — see [Managing module source](https://go.dev/doc/modules/managing-source) for details.

## Release notes

User-facing changes are recorded as **per-PR fragments** and assembled into
[`RELEASE-NOTES.md`](RELEASE-NOTES.md) at each release. One fragment file per PR
keeps this conflict-free.

1. Fill the `release-note` block in the PR description (write `NONE` if there is
   no user-facing impact).
2. For a user-facing change, add a fragment at
   `release-notes.d/unreleased/<PR-number>.md`:

   ```markdown
   ---
   pr: 123
   url: https://github.com/llm-d/llm-d-async/pull/123
   author: your-handle
   date: 2026-07-09
   ---
   Short description of the change. Prefix breaking changes with `Breaking:`.
   ```

3. `make release-notes-lint` validates fragment format (also enforced in CI via
   pre-commit).

At release time — as part of [Preparing a release](#preparing-a-release) — a
maintainer runs `make release-notes VERSION=vX.Y.Z`, which moves the unreleased
fragments into a new `RELEASE vX.Y.Z <date>` section at the top of
`RELEASE-NOTES.md` and deletes them. Commit the result with the release.

## Go Conventions

These conventions are enforced by linters where possible (see `.golangci.yml`) and by code review otherwise.

1. **No mutable package globals.** Use unexported state with constructors and accessors. Exceptions: Prometheus metric registrations (`pkg/metrics/`) and build-time version vars (`pkg/version/`).
2. **Compile-time interface assertions.** Every interface implementation (and test fake) must include `var _ Interface = (*Impl)(nil)` to catch breakage at compile time, not at runtime.
3. **Wrap errors with context.** When returning an error from an external package, wrap it: `fmt.Errorf("doing X: %w", err)`. This makes logs actionable.
4. **YAGNI.** Don't add exported functions, methods, or types without a caller in this repo. Unused API surface is maintenance burden.
5. **Porting rule.** When adapting code from EPP or another repo, strip it to what is actually called and re-fit it to local idioms before opening the PR.

## Security

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for our vulnerability disclosure process.

## API Changes and Deprecation

* **No breaking changes**: Once an API/protocol is in GA release, it cannot be removed or behavior changed
* **Versioning**: All protocols and APIs should be versionable with clear compatibility requirements
* **Documentation**: All APIs must have documented specs describing expected behavior
* **Deprecation policy (N+2)**: A feature deprecated in release N must keep working — with no user-facing or configuration change required — through releases N and N+1, emitting a clear warning, and may be removed no earlier than release N+2. Record the deprecation (and any breaking change) in the PR's [release note](#release-notes).
